# Voyant Demo

## Virginia Woolf
Author of numerous novels, short stories, and essays, Woolf was famous as a member of the English Bloomsbury group and as an advocate for women writers. Her essay "A Room of One's Own" because highly influential in feminist literary criticism. In addition, her prose style has been explored as an exemplar of "l'ecriture feminine." 

As a way to explore her work, I began by quickly cleaning and uploading five texts (novels) written between 1915 and 1941: 
- The Voyage Out 
- Mrs. Dalloway
- To the Lighthouse
- The Waves
- Between the Acts

I was curious about patterns of language and noticed that the word (token) "like" occurs with high frequency. This word can be used in several way: I _like_ you. But also, in figurative language, as the signal of a _simile_. 

First I wanted to see if it occurred evenly across all the novels:

So it grows in frequency across time, peaking in her second to last novel. 

Next I looked to see what other words it was associated with:

I decided I should probably find out if it is often or frequently used in the figurative sense.  I think that the terms in context tool will be useful for this:

As I read it, many of these occurrences are as _similes_.  Further research might require me to count these and then conmpare to some other texts.  Do other writers use "like" as a simile with this frequency? Eight of the first ten "likes" in the first novel are figurative. There is no _automatic_ way to get Voyant to count similes. But this has drawn my attention to the issue. I might then go on to read these and consider what kinds of things are being addressed in this way ... people, ideas, etc.
