    <h2>Twine Materials</h2>
    <p>
  Go to <a href="https://profsherwood.github.io/twine/TwineTeachingDemoSpring2016.html">Twine Teaching Demo Spring 2016 for an instance of how other files can be served from a web site.</a>
    </p>
    <p>Here is another Twine to explore; this is a test of <a href="https://profsherwood.github.io/twine/test.html">conditionals</a>. Remember you can <em>play</em> this from the web but you must open it in Twine to see the structure.
    </p>
    <p> Twine can also be styled in simple ways using CSS.  Here is a simple <a href="https://profsherwood.github.io/twine/SampleONly.html">example</a>  But don't add CSS directly to the file; go through the Twine story editor!
