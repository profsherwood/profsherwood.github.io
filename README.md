This is a simple readme, the first file.

This is my Github readme page. 

In order to publish files, I'll use Stackedit to compose in markdown or html. 
Stackedit can be configured to publish directly to Github.

Stackedit Configuration
=====================

Repository: 
------------
https://github.com/username/username.github.io

Branch:
-----------
master

File Path:
---------
filename.html
or
filename.md
or
folder/filename.html

Publishing Settings
====================
Markdown format will keep your content but not display well.

Template mode publishes HTML with the current CSS styles embedded. Or you can edit the template in Stackedit, pointing to a specific local or external CSS.
