This is a simple readme, the first file. It's a convention to use this to store relevant information that may or may not be accessed frequently. 

In order to publish files, I'll use Stackedit to compose in markdown or html. Other files can also be uploaded here, such as images or pdfs. You are limited to 1 GB.  Web uploads are usually capped at 25mb per file. 

Recommendations for using Github as a simple web host.
============

- the main file should be named index.html
- images should be put in an /images subfolder
- styles can be saved in a /styles folder or kept in the main directory. BUt you need to keep track of this and point to the right file. 

Stackedit can be configured to publish directly to Github. See directions below

StackEdit strips an external CSS from the file upon publishing. Instead, go to "settings" / "advanced" to add the appropriate CSS external file sheet link to the template. 


StackEdit Configuration
=====================

Repository: 
------------
https://github.com/username/username.github.io

Branch:
-----------
master

File Path:
---------
filename.html

or

filename.md

or

folder/filename.html

Publishing Settings
====================
Markdown format will keep your content but not display well.

Template mode publishes HTML with the current CSS styles embedded. Or you can edit the template in Stackedit, pointing to a specific local or external CSS. 

### Editing Styles
1. Create and upload an external style sheet (ex. style.css).  
2. In StackEdit, modify the settings / advanced / default template, so that it points to your stylesheet and not the default stackedit one.
